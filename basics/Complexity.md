# Complexity

## Time Complexity
  
  Rate at which the time taken descreases with respect to the input size.

  **Rules:**

  -> Time Complexity , in terms of worst case scenario.
  -> avoid constants.
  -> avoid lowervalues.

## Space Complexity
   
   ## Auxiliary Space
   -> space that you take to solve the problem.
   ## Input Space 
   -> the space that you take to store the system.
